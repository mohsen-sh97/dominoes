||-
||-

Output sample:
4

for example, the above input indicates that we only need to fall
4 dominoes. the first domino in first row, the first in second row
and the third in second row(which fall horizontally) and the first in 
third row. be carefull that we do not need to fall third domino in 
third row because it is already fallen by the third domino in second row.
